    title: 'Why do you work with health and wellness businesses, specifically?',
    description: html`<p>
      15 years deep into our professional journey, we're acutely aware of how
      easy it is to slip into an unhealthy lifestyle when you're busy. And,
      frankly, that story is all too common for people the world over. There are
      some incredible health and wellness companies out there making real change
      to people's lives, and we love the idea of dialing our focus into
      supporting those who are driving that change. We're also firm believers
      that happy, healthy people create better businesses.

    title: 'What does a completed set of research include?',
    description: html`<p>
      EVERYTHING you need to write (or have us write) compelling content that
      your target audience is currently searching for every day. That includes
      everything from an optimized title, to the key phrases you'll need to
      incorporate, to example sites that are ranking well in the same space, to
      specific guidance on how best to tailor the piece. We'll even include
      suggestions on how to position any relevant CTAs.

    description: html`<ul class="pl-zero">
      <li>
        Completely new idea, or a strategic re-work of content you already have
        live.
      </li>
      <li>Blog post, or landing page long form content</li>
      <li>Title to be used as the slug or URL</li>
      <li>Keyphrases to include in the content</li>
      <li>Example websites that rank highly for these keyphrases</li>

    title: 'Why do content assets come in landing pages or blog posts?',
    description: html`<p>
      In a world where distributing content usually happens on services we don't
      own (think Instagram, Facebook etc.), having a website with your own
      pages, blog and traffic is the only way to truly own your content assets.
      What people are actively searching for is best delivered via either a
      landing page or a blog post. Then, from these long-form content asset
      landing pages or blog posts, you can distribute multiple short-form
      content pieces from each and every asset across multiple social channels.

        make content research, creation, organization, and scheduling
        straightforward and effective. It's built for small business teams,
        freelancers and solopreneurs who want to create better content, faster.
        It will help you:

        research, competitive insights, key phrases for SEO, and creative
        inspiration, right where you plan and produce your content. This clever
        integration means you can easily reference your foundational research as
        you develop every piece of content.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-step-00">Create content that resonates</h3>

        Say goodbye to scattered documents and disjointed workflows. Content
        Machine brings harmony to your content strategy, enabling you to link
        short and long-form pieces, categorize your work, and keep everything in
        the same place. This smart organization reduces the time from concept to
        publication, allowing you to focus less on managing and more on
        creating.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-step-00">Schedule with precision</h3>
      <p>
        View your entire content calendar at a glance. Schedule, rearrange, plan
        ahead, and easily go back in time to find past work that's ripe for
        repurposing. The flexibility to adapt to new trends or audience needs
        will keep your content strategy dynamic and relevant. What you publish
        will always be on time, on brand.

        facilitates easy collaboration whenever you need it. Share feedback,
        suggestions, and edits in real time, right from the same space where
        you're creating and organizing your content. Collaboration, without the
        chaos.

    title: 'Will this help reduce my paid ad spend?',
    description: html`<p>
      Almost certainly, yes. The more of a domain authority you become (by
      search engines recognizing that you create high quality content that your
      audience wants to read), the more free, organic traffic your site will
      receive. This takes time, energy, and effort, but with the right content
      your organic traffic <em>will</em> grow.

    title: 'How does my subscription work?',
    description: html`<p>
      Subscriptions start immediately after you sign up and automatically renew
      every 4 weeks. If you need to pause your subscription, let us know and
      we'll note the days left in your current month. Upon unpausing, you'll
      still have those remaining days before your subscription renews again.
      While you're paused, your team's access level to the content machine is
      moved to comment only. If you decide you no longer need us, you can cancel
      at any time. Upon cancellation, your team's access level to the content
      machine is moved to view only. We'll hold everything there for 90 days
      after cancellation, after which your content machine and set of assets
      will no longer be available.
    </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Can I pause or cancel any time?',
    description: html`<p>
      Absolutely. Unlike the old agency model, we don't want to burden you with
      long-term, inflexible contracts and costs. You can switch our service on
      any time, and pause (or fully cancel) whenever your content needs drop
      down in importance.
    </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'What about refunds?',
    description: html`<p>
        Because our service is month to month, and because we deliver high
        quality work extremely quickly, we don't provide refunds. But you will
        only ever be charged for one month in advance, and you can cancel any
        time.

        <li>Renews every 4 weeks</li>

          Pausing means we keep your Content Machine on hold from adding
          anything new but you can still use it
        </li>
        <li>
          Canceling means you need to duplicate the Content Machine to your own
          Notion account
