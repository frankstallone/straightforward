      "description": "15 years deep into our professional journey, we're acutely aware of how easy it is to slip into an unhealthy lifestyle when you're busy. And, frankly, that story is all too common for people the world over. There are some incredible health and wellness companies out there making real change to people's lives, and we love the idea of dialling our focus into supporting those who are driving that change. We're also firm believers that happy, healthy people create better businesses."
