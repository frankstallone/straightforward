      <h3>What to expect</h3>
      <p>
        This call is to get a better understanding of you, your team, and your
        company. Through that lens we'll get into your challenges, and what
        you've tried. With a clear understanding of the current state of things
        we'll naturally talk through whether we're a good fit to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        No obligations. No hard sales. Simply a conversation to see if there is
        a mutual fit.
