<p>I am a fan of craft beer. There is no hiding this fact. Over the last few years I have taken a liking to a well balanced IPA. Despite my allure to Indian Pale Ales there are few variants I do not enjoy. There is nothing quite like enjoying a craft brew from a local brewery. There is a bit of intoxicated pride involved.</p>
<p>What we have here is a very special beer from <a href="http://www.riverhorse.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Opens in a new tab">River Horse Brewing Company</a> called <a href="https://riverhorse.com/beers/roly-poly-pils/" target="_blank" aria-label="Opens in a new tab">Roly Poly Pils</a>. A delicious Pilsner that is refreshing, flavorful and easy to drink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex balance of malts round out Czech Saaz and German Hallertau hops, followed by a clean and crisp finish. A classic Czech-style Pilsner, our Roly Poly Pils is a super drinkable and tasty year round beer! - 5.3%</p>

<p>This particular pilsner doesn't only appeal to the sense of taste. The visual senses are seduced by the branding. <a href="https://chriscoddingtondesign.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Opens in a new tab">Chris Coddington Design of Flemington New Jersey</a> artistry was judiciously commissioned to bring a playful and wobbly hippo to the package design. After a few of these pilsner's one may wish they too had a nice low center of gravity that will aid in an upright orientation.</p>
