  If you’re working on a web app or product, you’ve probably heard of the title
  UX designer, or user experience designer, and UI designer, or user interface
  designer. These are two common design jobs you’ll find, each with distinctive
  skills sets, and some overlap. Let’s take a deeper look.
</p>

<p>
  UX designers focus more on solutions to user problems. In order to do this
  effectively, deep and thorough knowledge of what the user’s needs are is
  needed. Drawing out the user’s journey through the product, ensuring logic to
  the flow, and deploying wireframes, prototypes and user testing to ensure
  things work best are all within the realm of expertise for a UX designer.
</p>
<p>
  UI designers focus more on the visual aesthetics of the product. Designing the
  user interface has it’s own set of design problems. They are guiding the user
  through visual storytelling. The nitty gritty details of individual parts of
  the product’s look and feel, on all different devices the product might be
  viewed on, are in the UI designers wheel house.

    "A UX designer is concerned with the conceptual aspects of the design
    process, leaving the UI designer to focus on the more tangible elements"

<p>
  Both roles should be engaged with each other, product owners, stakeholders,
  developers and other members of the team to ensure alignment. There is also
  overlap between the roles. UI designers may not be doing user research, but
  they are designing elements that typically resemble well known design patterns
  which have been developed from proven good user experiences. UX designers may
  not be using those design patterns exactly, but they need to understand how
  they work in order for their wireframes or prototypes to be effective. Both
  roles do
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WI3B54m6SU">design thinking</a>, prototyping,
  and deploy some level of empathy with the user.
</p>
<p>
  From my experience, enterprise UX designer roles came with the expectation
  that you were also a UI designer. I’ve been in numerous business units that
  wanted me to employ UX design principals and follow up with the high polished
  UI to pass off to development.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, I would do the front-end development of those UI components. I
  created ‘kitchen sinks’ with all of the front-end components on a single page.
  This was before design systems. Then, I would create and manage the design
  systems for
  <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/">
    the back-of-the-frontend developers
  </a>
  or backend developers. This would sometimes be it’s own title. I’ve heard UX
  engineer,
  <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-better-book-design-engineering/">
    Design engineer
  </a>
  or Design technologist coined for these ‘unicorns’. Somehow in attempting to
  create clarity between these two types of roles, I feel like I may have
  slightly complicated things. Such is life. Not everything is as it seems! I do
  hope this provided some clarity. If not, feel free to ask me about my design
  and development experiences.
