  In business, accessibility on the web and for digital devices, is a topic rife
  with ignorance. From organizational culture, to product owners, to designers
  and developers, we’re all responsible. It’s also a fundamental
  <a href="https://adata.org/learn-about-ada">civil right</a>&nbsp;
  <a href="https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/employers/disability-discrimination">
    in many
  </a> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada.html">
    countries
  </a>. Today we’re going to take a peak at the four principals the WCAG consider
  guidelines and success criteria.
</p>
<p>
  On the surface, you’d be forgiven for not putting effort into accessible
  considerations if you’ve been working in the field for years and haven’t had a
  single OKR, KPO or task related to the topic. However, if you are building a
  digital product or service in 2023 and beyond, you should be considering all
  your users.
</p>
<p>What are some traits linked to disabilities?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical like vision loss, hearing loss, or mobility issues</li>
  <li>Neurodivergent like attention deficit disorder, dyslexia or autism</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The way I have broached the topic to executives is by saying, “You wouldn’t
  stop a patron from coming to your physical store, to purchase your products or
  services, because they were in a wheelchair.” On the contrary you would
  install wheelchair ramps, powered doors and other accessibility considerations
  to make their access easy.
</p>
<p>
  The topic of accessibility is a deep one, with a wealth of knowledge
  available. We’ll scratch the surface today with Web Content Accessibility
  Guidelines (WCAG) which are international standard guidelines. First
  introduced in 1999, the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">
    latest stable document is version 2.1
  </a>. Today, we’re specifically going to look at the 4 principals the WCAG consider
  guidelines and success criteria, and I’ll use examples to thread everything together.
</p>
<p>
  Aside, there is a whole

</p>
<h2>1 Perceivable</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Information and user interface components that must be presentable in ways
    users can perceive
  </strong>
  . If you have imagery that has useful information a user needs in your application,
  a text alternative for screen readers is crucial, or else that information is lost.
  Another example is having color contrasts for text and backgrounds that meets AA
  or AAA contrast ratios for low vision users.

<h2>2 Operable</h2>
<p>
  <strong>User interface components and navigation must be operable</strong>. I
  have worked on more than a few React apps that have had zero keyboard
  affordances for screen readers to interact with navigations, accordions for
  progressive disclosure, or a simple button. Using aria attributes and semantic
  HTML can solve these problems.
</p>
<h2>3 Understandable</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable
  </strong>
  . I am reminded an app I am using daily that has important navigation items as
  icons with no supplemental information saying what it does. As a fully sighted
  user I have no idea what it does until I click on them. I am supposed to ‘know’
  what the icons mean visually. For low or no vision users, the buttons are simply
  inaccessible.
</p>

<h2>4 Robust</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide
    variety of user agents, including assistive technologies
  </strong>
  . To clarify a bit more “user agent” is a request header that your browser (or
  other device) sends and lets the server identify information about your device.
</p>
<p>
  Using web standard markup correctly, and sometimes adding specific attributes
  placed on that markup is the primary solution. Using the icon examples above,
  adding title tags to graphical elements and a role attribute helps devices
  know, and deliver that information to all users.
</p>
<p>
  That’s already a lot of information, and I don’t even know if I’d call this
  scratching the surface! What else would you like to know about digital
  accessibility? Feel free to reach out to me and let me know!
